# Real Estate Website by Charles ILOKA
# What the project does
The Real Estate Website is a PHP-based web application with a MySQL database backend. It is designed to provide users with a user-friendly and responsive interface for searching, viewing, and contacting agents for preferred properties. Users can browse properties by categories and get in touch with agents effortlessly. Additionally, there is an admin interface for property management, including the ability to add, edit, and delete properties and associated images.

# Why the project is useful
This project serves as a valuable platform for both real estate buyers and agents. Users can easily find properties that match their preferences through category-based searching and interact with agents directly, streamlining the property purchasing process. The admin interface simplifies property management tasks, making it convenient for administrators to keep property listings up-to-date.
